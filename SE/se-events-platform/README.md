# **Community Events Platform**

## **Welcome to the Community Events Platform!**

I have built this platform to help you and your community stay connected by making it easier to create, manage, and join events. Whether you're a community member looking to sign up for an exciting local event or a staff member organising one, this platform is designed with you in mind. It’s simple, intuitive, and responsive, so you can access it anytime, anywhere.

## **What Can You Do Here?**

- **Browse Events**: Easily browse through upcoming events in your community.
- **Sign Up**: Find an event you like? Sign up in a few clicks!
- **Add to Google Calendar**: After signing up, add the event directly to your Google Calendar to keep track of it.
- **For Staff Members**: If you're part of the staff, you’ll have special access to create, update, and manage events.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is designed to work beautifully across devices – whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop.

## **What We’ve Built (MVP)**

Our platform meets the following MVP requirements:

- Display a list of events for users to browse through.
- Allow users to sign up for events.
- Add events to your Google Calendar after signing up.
- Enable staff members to sign in, create, and manage events.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: Built with React.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js
- **Authentication**: I have used JWT user authentication.
- **Google Calendar API**: Integrating Google Calendar to help you stay organised.
- **Hosting**: ADD HOSTING DETAILS

## **How to Get Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you start, you'll need:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Yarn (or npm)
- Google Calendar API credentials (to use the calendar integration)

### **Clone the Repo**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nc-se-events-platform.git
cd nc-se-events-platform
## **Install Dependencies**

Install the necessary dependencies using Yarn (or npm):

```bash
yarn install
```

Or, if you prefer npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## **Set Up Environment Variables**

You’ll need to create a `.env.development` file in your node.js (backend) and connect to your database. Filling in your database for the following fields.

PGDATABASE=
DB_PORT=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=

## **Run the Project Locally**

To get the project up and running on your local machine, use the following command in your front end and back end:

```bash

Or, if you're using npm:

This will start the app and open it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
